Roar is a school project to evaluate two subjects: Distributed Systems üï∏Ô∏è & Machine Learning üíª.

## About

Currently there are numerous social networks where users establish a graph of relationships and based on these relationships, the dynamics of the functioning of the social network are established. Examples of these networks are Facebook or Twitter to cite a couple of cases.

The project consists of implementing a distributed social network for communication following the idea on which Twitter is based. Following the operating philosophy of Twitter, the system must provide an infrastructure for managing users, so that they can publish their messages, re-publish messages that they consider interesting from other users, and choose who will be their friends. In addition, as part of user management, a mechanism for distributed authentication must be provided in such a way that a model that is not centralized is achieved.
